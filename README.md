Overview

This is a simple Java console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
The program allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to get the result.

Simple, user-friendly console interface

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or above)

Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or a simple text editor

Command-line terminal (if running without an IDE)

How to Run

Download or create the Java file: Calculator.java

Compile the program using the terminal or IDE:

javac Calculator.java

Code Structure

The program uses Scanner to read user input from the console.

A switch statement is used to determine which operation to perform.

Division by zero is handled with a simple conditional check to prevent runtime errors.

Future Enhancements

Add support for multiple calculations in a loop without restarting the program

Implement advanced operations like power, square root, or modulus

Create a GUI version using Swing or JavaFX for better user experience
